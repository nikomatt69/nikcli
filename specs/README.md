# Architecture Specs

Planning baseline: 2026-09-10. Scope: `packages/tui` and `packages/nikcli`, including their SDK, identity, observability,
bridge, and host seams.

Start with the [integrated roadmap](ROADMAP.md). These are implementation specifications, not claims that the proposed
changes or performance targets have shipped. All twenty-one specs are **proposed**. No benchmark was run to establish a
runtime baseline during this documentation change; the measured figures quoted in the roadmap's
[Landed Slices](ROADMAP.md#landed-slices) come from the individual slices, not from this catalog.

The register below is a snapshot of an inspection, and several of its line references have since drifted as the
slices in that table landed. A `file:line` that no longer resolves is a stale citation, not evidence that the
observation was wrong — re-read the file before acting on an entry.

Paths are relative to the repository root. Line references describe this inspection, not permanent API anchors.
An observed implementation surface is not automatically a proven runtime bug.

## Pinned Technique References

The workspace has no root `node_modules/effect/AGENTS.md`; the installed reference is
`packages/nikcli/node_modules/effect/AGENTS.md`. Read that file and its sibling `ai-docs/src`, not an unrelated v3 tutorial.
Confirmed in this installation: `Context.Service`, `Schema.TaggedError`, `Effect.fn`, `Effect.tryPromise`,
`Effect.acquireRelease`, `Effect.forkScoped`, `Queue.bounded`, `PubSub.bounded`, `Schedule.exponential`,
`Schedule.jittered`, and `Schedule.recurs`. Exact composition semantics must be checked when implementing.

Relevant installed examples:

- `packages/nikcli/node_modules/effect/ai-docs/src/01_effect/05_resources/10_acquire-release.ts`
- `packages/nikcli/node_modules/effect/ai-docs/src/06_schedule/10_schedules.ts`
- `packages/nikcli/node_modules/effect/ai-docs/src/01_effect/03_services/20_layer-composition.ts`
- `packages/nikcli/node_modules/effect/node_modules/effect/ai-docs/src/02_schema/02_tagged-errors.ts`

OpenTUI skill pages read: `/docs/bindings/solid`, `/docs/core-concepts/renderer`, and `/docs/core-concepts/keyboard`.
Those documentation routes are references, not repository files. Check the installed declarations before selecting APIs:
`packages/tui/node_modules/@opentui/core/renderer.d.ts`,
`packages/tui/node_modules/@opentui/core/renderables/ScrollBox.d.ts`, and
`packages/tui/node_modules/@opentui/solid/index.d.ts`.
`testRender`, `requestRender`, `requestLive`, `dropLive`, typed `scrollTop`/`scrollHeight`, `scrollChildIntoView`, `viewportCulling`, and `MacOSScrollAccel` exist in the 0.5.11 pin.
Do not assume an `onScroll` JSX prop or browser DOM virtualization library exists for this renderer.
Manual `child.y - scroll.y` is wrong on `ScrollBoxRenderable`: `y` is the box origin, not the scroll offset.

## Subsystem Documents Outside This Catalog

The EOT catalog above is one program. These documents describe subsystems that already shipped, or
decisions that are not part of that program. They are not EOT specs and carry their own status.

## Existing Plans and Compatibility

At the original inspection, `specs/` was empty, `docs/architecture/` did not exist (and still does not), and no
on-disk roadmap was found in `specs`, `docs`, or `.goals`.
Live source comments for TUI extraction, event delivery, cache eviction, request throttling, message virtualization,
plugin v2 selection, and the new llm package now point at this catalog.

`specs/v2/`, `specs/storage/`, `specs/tui-package.md` and `specs/PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md` were deleted in af5546f8c9, a commit
whose message covers only TUI tests. They are restored: 38 source comments cite them, and
`test/cli/command-surface.test.ts` reads `specs/v2/cli-command-surface.md` as a gate, so its loss made that test fail on
HEAD. Those documents record subsystems that **shipped**; the specs in this catalog are **proposed**. They are not
alternatives to each other, and this catalog does not mark the historical documents complete or superseded. Existing
[sync architecture documentation](../docs/sync-architecture.md) remains a reference; recheck implementation details
before changing replay semantics.

## Open Payloads

This is the continuation point for the open-payload policy referenced by `packages/nikcli/AGENTS.md`.
It is not an audited allowlist of current endpoints. EOT-10 must inventory each intentional open payload with operation,
schema location, owner, justification, and a runtime/consumer test. Only genuine opaque passthroughs, polymorphic event
payloads, SSE frames, or bodyless redirects qualify; an ordinary domain success object does not. Never introduce
`Schema.Unknown` merely to make response encoding or generated-client validation pass.

## Observability Schema and Redaction Discipline

EOT-13 owns the canonical span/metric/log schema. The high-level rules are enforced across every spec:

- Spans are stable, lower-cased, dotted, and use `Tracer` directly.
- Span attributes are drawn from a fixed schema; forbidden dimensions include raw prompts, completions, file paths,
  URLs with credentials, tokens, OAuth codes, PKCE verifiers, emails, account ids, IP addresses, and request bodies.
  Prompts may only appear as a stable hash and a length bucket.
- Metric labels share the same forbidden-dimension list; histograms use the Effect default buckets.
- Logs flow through `Log` with structured JSON output and redacted sinks (`safeStringify`, `redactUrl`). Spans
  correlate to logs through `trace_id`/`span_id`.
- The live TUI panel reads from `telemetry-bus` and is rate-limited; it never blocks the input thread.
- OTLP export is opt-in (`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT`); the live panel is default-on. Redaction is not a
  configurable option.

## Workspace Scope Discipline

EOT-16 owns the canonical workspace model. The high-level rules are enforced across every spec:

- A workspace is a typed Effect scope, not a label on a request.
- Per-workspace mutable state is namespaced by `WorkspaceRef`; cross-workspace leakage is a typed failure.
- Hot switch is a deterministic, cancellable operation; durable background jobs survive, ephemeral resources do not.
- Concurrent workspaces share the process runtime, not the resource scopes.
- Duplicate workspace identity reuses the existing scope; identity mismatch creates a parallel scope.

## Permission, Sandbox, and Policy Discipline

EOT-17 owns the canonical permission/sandbox/policy boundary. The high-level rules are enforced across every spec:

- Every cross-boundary call routes through `Permission.evaluate`; undeclared permission requirements are runtime
  refusals.
- A deny is terminal; a prompt is the default for undeclared operations.
- The sandbox is containment at the OS level (file/path/network restrictions), not cryptographic isolation.
- Network policy routes every outbound HTTP/WS/raw TCP through the runtime `HttpClient`; bypass is a defect.
- Audit logs are redacted; prompts, secrets, file contents, and arbitrary request bodies are never recorded.
- Headless mode fails closed unless every required decision is pre-resolved.
