// Provider-options namespaces — one typed facade per provider, modeled after
// opencode's `provider/transform.ts`. Each module exports a `<Provider>OptionsInput`
// type, a `<provider>DefaultOptions(modelID)` per-model resolver, and a
// `with<Provider>Options(modelID, options)` helper used by the provider facades.
