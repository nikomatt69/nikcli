/**
 * A scripted LLM for deterministic tests.
 *
 * Tests that drive a real model exchange otherwise reach for module-level response globals, hand
 * written SSE strings and polling loops to synchronise on tool calls. All three make failures hard
 * to read: the assertion that fails is nowhere near the response that caused it. `TestLLM` scripts
 * responses in the order they will be consumed, and — by default — fails loudly when the code under
 * test asks for one more than was scripted, which is usually the actual bug.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const llm = TestLLM.make()
 * llm.push(TestLLM.text("hello"))
 * llm.push(TestLLM.toolCall("read", { filePath: "a.ts" }))
 *
 * await program.pipe(Effect.provide(llm.layer), Effect.runPromise)
 * expect(llm.exhausted()).toBe(true)
 * ```
