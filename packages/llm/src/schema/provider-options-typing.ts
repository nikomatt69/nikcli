/**
 * Type-level plumbing that lets a model carry the shape of the provider options it accepts.
 *
 * `ProviderOptions` is `Record<string, Record<string, unknown>>` on the wire and stays that way —
 * every provider must be able to pass knobs nikcli has never heard of. But at a call site the model
 * is known, so `providerOptions` can be checked against *that provider's* documented options rather
 * than against `unknown`. A typo like `{ anthropic: { thinkingBudget: 4000 } }` (the field is
 * `thinking`) is otherwise accepted silently and simply ignored by the provider.
 *
 * The carrier is a phantom property: it exists only in the type system, so nothing changes at
 * runtime, nothing is serialized, and a plain `ModelRef` still works everywhere it did before.
