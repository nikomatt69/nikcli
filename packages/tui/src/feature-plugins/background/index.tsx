/**
 * Background image — internal TUI plugin.
 *
 * Mirrors `feature-plugins/browser`: a self-contained plugin that owns one
 * feature end to end. It paints a real image behind the TUI — truecolor cell
 * backgrounds, composed by OpenTUI's native super-sampler — the way a terminal
 * wallpaper would, without needing the terminal to support one, and registers
 * the `/background` command that configures it. Nothing renders until an
 * image is picked.
 *
 * The plugin owns the settings, the dialogs and the commands, but *not* the
 * mounting: `app.tsx` renders {@link ./view#BackgroundImage} itself. Going
 * through a slot would nest the image under a `SlotRenderable`, where its
 * `zIndex: -1` only sorts against that node's own children — against the app
 * it would keep the order it was mounted in and paint over the tabs and the
 * prompt. Being a direct child of the app root is what puts it behind.
