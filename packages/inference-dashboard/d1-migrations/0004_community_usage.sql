-- Opt-in usage reports from nikcli installs.
--
-- `usage_events` only ever sees traffic that went through the inference
-- gateway. Most nikcli users bring their own provider keys, so their models
-- never appear there — which is the whole picture nikcli.store/data was
-- missing. This table holds what those installs choose to report: one row per
-- install, day, provider and model, and nothing else.
--
-- What is deliberately absent is the point: no prompt, no path, no repository,
-- no session title, no account, no IP. `install_id` is a random identifier the
-- CLI generates for itself; it exists so a resend replaces a day rather than
-- doubling it, and so unique installs per day can be counted. It is never
-- published — the public feed only ever emits COUNT(DISTINCT install_id).
