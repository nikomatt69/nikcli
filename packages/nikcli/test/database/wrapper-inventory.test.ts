 * The gate for `specs/storage/retire-database-wrapper.md`.

 * That document plans the removal of the synchronous `Database` surface and
 * sequences it by group. A plan with a number in it and no check is a number
 * that drifts, so this asserts the direction of travel: the count may fall, and
 * may not rise.
 *
 * When a group lands, lower the baseline in the same change. When a new call
 * site is genuinely required, raise it deliberately and say why — do not widen
 * the tolerance.
