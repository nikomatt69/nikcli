/**
 * Turn model for the session view — the seam between the renderer and the
 * conversation data.
 *
 * The renderer draws from v2 entries, the model every other client (mobile,
 * desktop, plugins, SDK) already uses:
 *
 *     fromEntries(entries) ─► Turn[] ─► renderer
 *
 * It used to have a second source, `fromMessages`, converting v1 messages and
 * parts into the same turns; the migration ran with both behind a flag until
 * the entry source had soaked, and the pair was held equivalent by test. That
 * is finished — entries are the only source now, so there is one shape in
 * memory instead of two and nothing has to prove they agree.
 *
 * **The unit is the turn, and a turn is a message.** That is deliberate: the
 * renderer virtualizes over messages (see `MESSAGE_HEIGHT_ESTIMATE` in
 * index.tsx), and keying turns on `messageID` keeps the number of windowed
 * units — and therefore the scroll maths, the fork/revert dialogs and
 * `TurnUsage` — exactly where they are. Entries carry `messageID` precisely
 * so this grouping is free.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free: no Solid, no store access, no SDK client.
 * It takes data and returns data, which is why it can be tested without
 * standing up a TUI — same rule as `rows.ts`.

/**
 * Keep the object identity of turns that did not change.
 *
 * The renderer draws the turn list with Solid's `<For>`, which reconciles by
 * **reference**. `fromEntries` allocates a fresh `Turn` for every message on
 * every run, so without this every entry that arrives — a tool call, a new
 * text part, the `complete` that seals the turn — handed `<For>` an entirely
 * new list and made it dispose and recreate *every message in the
 * conversation*. That is the flicker: the whole transcript is torn down and
 * repainted several times per assistant turn, and it gets worse the longer the
 * session runs.
 *
 * Returning the previous object for an unchanged turn means `<For>` leaves it
 * mounted. Only the turn that actually changed is rebuilt.
 *
 * Comparing `body` by reference is what makes this work *and* what keeps
 * streamed text live: entries are updated in place in the sync store
 * (`setStore(..., reconcile(entry))`), so a token delta does not change any
 * reference here — the turn stays identical and the leaf component, which
 * reads `entry.text` through the store, repaints on its own. A turn is only
 * rebuilt when its set of entries changes.
