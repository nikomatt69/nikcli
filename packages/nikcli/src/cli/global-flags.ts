 * The flags every nikcli command accepts, declared once on the root.

 * them into process state. They have to exist here before the effect CLI can be
 * the entrypoint: an undeclared `--auto` is a parse error, not an ignored flag,
 * so flipping the default without them would break every scripted invocation
 * that passes one.
 *
 * The *effects* of these flags live in `main-effect.ts`'s bootstrap rather than
 * in a handler, because they configure the process — logging, permission
 * defaults, the Island bridge — before any command runs.

 * Two adjustments, both because yargs special-cased things effect does not:
 *
 * - `--log-level DEBUG` → `--log-level debug`, since effect's built-in flag
 *   declares lower-case choices and nikcli has always taken upper-case.
 * - A leading path (`nikcli ~/proj`) becomes `--project ~/proj`. yargs' default
 *   command could own a positional while subcommands still matched; in effect an
 *   optional positional on the root swallows the subcommand name as soon as a
 *   flag follows, so `nikcli heap --detailed` would run the TUI. Rewriting here
 *   keeps the spelling users type without giving the root a positional.
