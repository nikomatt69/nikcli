/**
 * Anonymous usage reporting, on by default.
 *
 * nikcli.store/data can only show what the inference gateway served, which is a
 * small slice of what nikcli actually runs: most people bring their own
 * provider keys, and those models never reach the gateway. This sends the
 * per-day, per-model totals the CLI already keeps locally, so the public page
 * reflects the models developers really use.
 *
 * Defaulting to on is what makes the picture representative — an opt-in sample
 * measures the people who opted in — so the burden is on this file to be worth
 * that default:
 *
 *   - only aggregates leave the machine: day, provider, model, session count,
 *     message count, token count, cost. No prompt, no file path, no repository,
 *     no session title, no account, no environment, no IP beyond the one any
 *     HTTP request carries;
 *   - the install identifier is a random v4 UUID generated here and kept
 *     locally. The server uses it only to replace a day rather than double it,
 *     and to count distinct installs. It is never published;
 *   - turning it off is a single flag, and the two conventional environment
 *     opt-outs are honoured before the config is even read, so a machine that
 *     has said "do not track" is never asked twice;
 *   - a failure is silent and retried later. Reporting must never be something
 *     the user notices, in either direction.
