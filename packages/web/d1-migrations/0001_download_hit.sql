-- Where downloads come from, at country granularity.
--
-- GitHub and npm both publish a download counter and nothing else: a release
-- asset carries `download_count`, an integer, and npm's API returns totals per
-- day. Neither exposes geography in any form, to anyone, so the map on
-- nikcli.store/data cannot be derived from them — the dimension does not exist
-- upstream.
--
-- It exists here instead. `install` and `install.ps1` already fetch from
-- nikcli.store/releases/download/<tag>/<asset> as their primary URL, so the
-- request passes our edge before it reaches GitHub. That request carries
-- `cf-ipcountry`, which is the country, resolved by Cloudflare, without asking
-- the client for anything. The route records it and redirects; the file is
-- still served by GitHub and GitHub's own counter still increments, so the
-- totals stay reconcilable against STATS.md.
--
-- What is deliberately absent, as everywhere else behind /data: no address, no
-- user agent, no identifier of any kind. A day, a country and an asset name is
-- the whole row. Nothing here can be traced to a person, and nothing here is a
-- location — a country is the coarsest geographic fact there is.
--
-- This counts from the day it ships. Downloads already in STATS.md have no
-- country and never will, so the page shows this as its own measurement rather
-- than back-filling a history it cannot know.
