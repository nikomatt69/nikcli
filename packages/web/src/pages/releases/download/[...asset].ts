/**
 * nikcli.store/releases/download/<tag>/<asset> — the download path the
 * installers already use.
 *
 * `install` sets this as `release_url_primary` and falls back to
 * github.com/.../releases/download on failure; `install.ps1` puts it first in
 * its candidate list. Both have been doing so against a 404, so every install
 * has been taking the fallback and the primary URL has been dead weight.
 *
 * Making it work buys the one thing GitHub cannot give us: the country. A
 * release asset's `download_count` is an integer with no dimensions, and npm
 * publishes only per-day totals, so the geographic breakdown on /data has no
 * upstream to come from. Here the request passes our edge, which resolves
 * `cf-ipcountry` on its own, and we record a day, a country and an asset name
 * before handing the download to GitHub.
 *
 * The redirect target is the real `browser_download_url`, so GitHub still
 * serves the bytes and still counts the download. This route adds a dimension
 * to that number; it does not replace it, and the two stay reconcilable.
 *
 * Counting must never cost a download. The insert runs inside `waitUntil`, so
 * the 302 goes out immediately, and every failure path — no database, a
 * rejected write, a missing country — still redirects.
