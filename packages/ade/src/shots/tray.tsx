/**
 * The screenshots you just took, waiting to be handed to an agent.
 *
 * Bottom left, over the grid rather than beside it: a strip that pushed the
 * terminals aside would cost every session a slice of width for something that
 * is empty most of the time. It sits in the corner the sidebar already occupies,
 * where nothing is ever drawn, and folds away to a single word when unwanted.
 *
 * A thumbnail is dragged onto the session that should see it. Dropping writes
 * the path into that terminal and stops — no newline — because which agent gets
 * the picture and what to ask about it are two different decisions, and only the
 * first one is made by the drag.
