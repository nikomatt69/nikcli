/**
 * The voice chords as the operating system sees them.
 *
 * On the desktop the two voice chords are registered as global hotkeys, so
 * the microphone opens while another window has the keyboard. That has a
 * cost inside ADE's own window too: a registered hotkey is taken by the OS
 * before the webview ever gets a `keydown`, so for those two chords the
 * `window` listener in the workbench never fires and the only word ADE hears
 * is the plugin's event. Whatever that event does is therefore the whole
 * feature for anyone who set a chord of their own.
 *
 * It used to look for the letter "j" or "k" in the event's text. "Ctrl+Space"
 * contains neither, so a user who chose it pressed a key that the OS
 * swallowed and ADE dropped — nothing at all happened. This module names the
 * chord on both sides of the boundary so the comparison is on chords, not on
 * letters.
 *
 * Plain `.ts`: everything here is string work against the `global-hotkey`
 * crate's grammar, and that grammar is the thing worth asserting.
