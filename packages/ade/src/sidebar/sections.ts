/**
 * Which sidebar sections are open, and which one gives way when they do not fit.
 *
 * The second question is the whole point of this file. The sidebar used to
 * give "Progetti" a height in pixels, stored and dragged: with one project in
 * the list that produced roughly four hundred pixels of nothing between the
 * project list and the file tree, and no amount of styling fixes a box that
 * has been told to be that tall. Sections are sized to their content.
 *
 * What is left over stays at the foot of the column, under the last section.
 * Handing it to a section instead was the same bug wearing different clothes:
 * with the file tree shut, the leftover went to "Agenti attivi", which then
 * stretched and pushed the shut "File" header all the way to the bottom with
 * a field of nothing above it. Nothing stretches; the one section named below
 * is simply the one allowed to shrink and scroll when the content is taller
 * than the column.
 *
 * Pure, and separate from the component, because a `.tsx` has no automatic JSX
 * runtime under `bun test` in this repo — the rules below would otherwise be
 * untestable by construction.

 *
 * `file` wins when it is open: a file tree is unbounded and is the thing
 * people scroll, while a project list is a handful of rows that knows its own
 * size. When `file` is shut the active agents or projects take the squeeze
 * instead, and when all are shut nothing does — there is nothing to scroll.
 *
 * It does not make that section taller. Below its content it stops, and the
 * unused height stays where it belongs, at the foot of the column.
