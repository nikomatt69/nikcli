### Highlights

- **Effect Schema Migration Phase P**: Completed migration of core domains to Effect Schema for improved type safety and composability.
- **New modules migrated**: Sync, Workspace, SessionStatus, File.Node/Content, Sandbox.Ref/State, BackgroundRun, Log.Level, ModelsDev, Provider.Model/Info
- **Additional migrations**: Connectors, Vcs.Info, Worktree, Project, ProviderAuth, MCP resources/auth, BusEvent, Delegation, Bus
- **Docker improvements**: Added wake notification for background tasks, Dockerfile updates

### Migration Notes

This release continues the Effect Schema migration pattern established in previous versions. Key changes include:

- Schema definitions now use `effect`'s `Schema` module instead of Zod for internal validation
- Service interfaces remain unchanged; consumers of existing APIs should experience no breaking changes
- New Effect-based error types provide better stack traces and cause chain debugging
